# helpdeskconnection
First Enterprise-Wide Application I wrote after college.  Windows app that allows a user to see their network and computer information, along with giving them a quick UI to release/renew IP and validate that they have a connection to the internet.

Currently the app does the following tasks:
- displays the user's IP information
- gives user the ability to reset IPs with just a click of a button
- gives user a visual interface to get info on computer name and network set up
- allows user to determine internet connectivity via backend pings and trace route commands

  Was mainly built an easy tool that our users could open in order to help them give information to the help desk tech they had called when they experienced any technical issues.  Originally built in 2007 to solve the problem of "How to we get IP info from users without having them open a command prompt?"
